    title: Profile
    summary: |
      Hello! I am Sengul, a 20-year-old Computer Science graduate from the University of Bristol passionate 
      about blending creativity and technology. Since I was 17, I've been captivated by programming, 
      crafting dynamic programs and innovative websites. My journey began in high school, where I scored a perfect 7/7 
      in Computer Science during my IB diploma and wrote a 30-page Extended Essay that marked my 
      introduction to web development and scientific evaluation.
      Most recently, I completed my Bachelor Thesis, achieving a 75% mark, where I honed these skills 
      to a professional level with the inclusion of AI. I am now seeking remote or hybrid opportunities in Europe
      or on-site in Groningen in the Netherlands, where I can dive into my passions: web development, 
      game development, and all of the creative intersections within tech.

      - role: Intern (Full Stack Development)
        time: 2023
        company: CYENS, Nicosia
        details: |
          I, initially, joined a 2-person team as the frontend lead. I familiarized myself with Streamlit and the front/backend pipeline.
          Later, the backend representative of the team changed and I helped onboard the new member, facilitating a smooth transition.
          Towards the end of the project, I was the only intern remaining in the team and so I took on managing the fullstack pipeline as
          well as deplpyment. To note, the website is not currently accessible.
          We developed an AI-driven interactive storyteller for kids, enabling them to create 
          fictional and historical stories through AI-generated options. 
          The user would enter an initial prompt for the story, and thereafter would continue said story via the AI-generated options.
          The project was inspired by choose your own adventure story books.
          As an extension to the project I also integrated a text-to-image AI API, Stable Diffusion to accompany the story.
          The project was interactive via story continuation, AI hyper-parameter customizations; and 
          open-ended as the story wouldn't end until you wanted it to.
          Project presentation available here. Below is a slide from said presentation giving a condensed overview of the website's features.
          - OpenAI API chat completions
          - Stable Diffusion API
          - Streamlit frontend design & deployment
          - Python backend 
          - Team synergy, collaborative coding
      - role: Intern (Design)
        time: 2020
        company: DesignLab Marketing/Advertising, Nicosia
        details: |
          My interest in digital design has been ever-present, however I was able to put it into formal action during 
          my work experience at DesignLab. 
          Shadowing work in a creative office developed my communication skills as it allowed me to share my ideas freely. 
          I, then, went onto do practical work in the digital media field; strengthening my independent 
          learning on Adobe Photoshop and GIMP.
          During and after my internship, I continued learning about two platforms
          for digital design: Photoshop (the commercial standard), and GIMP (a commonly used alternative). 
          I explored both these softwares beyond the scope of my initial internship (digital marketing), making preliminary 
          posters and websites with a range of media.
          - Collaborative brainstorming
          - 2D marketing design

        company: PeacePlayers Basketball, Nicosia

      - title: Stormboard (Bachelor Thesis)
        link: "https://stormboard.vercel.app/"
        tagline: "An AI-powered brainstorming website enquiring the creativity and collaboration of autonomous AI."
        details: |
          In my first class bachelor thesis I explored the fields of Artifical Intelligence and Human-Computer Interaction.
          I developed a node-based graphical user interface, digitally mirroring brainstorming with 
          sticky notes, given a contextual design brief, and added the feature to 'supercharge' these sticky notes. 
          [Repository link (with access to Thesis PDF)](https://github.com/SengulC/stormboard-client)

          A user can supercharge their notes in the following ways:
          - Add an AI-created note
          - Summarize/Expand on a note
          - Merge 1+ notes into another note
          - Semantically group 1+ notes
          - Find the semantic opposite of a note
          - Add randomness a given note 

          Moreover, I wanted to explore the concept of autonomous AI, and how the collaboration of 
          human and AI agents affects human creativity.
          Thus, I created three distinct AI personas, with ranging levels of autonomy and 
          with each having their own stylistic tone to their additions/modifications. These are:
          - Hades with no autonomy and a netural tone,
          - Apollo with full autonomy^ and a descriptive, creative tone,
          - Themis with slight autonomy^^ and a precise, succinct tone.

          ^ can manipulate user's notes in any of the above supercharged ways

          ^^ summarizes all of user's notes in a user-chosen time period (e.g. every 2 seconds)

        # then add video to repo and ask for repo to be public
        tagline: "A first class collaborative software engineering project, where I developed a Unity game with my team mates."
        details: |
          This project, spanning an entire academic year, was the perfect introduction to collaborative software engineering with a real client.
          We held frequent meetings, delegated work to each team mate, managed and overcame miscommunications 
          and disagreements, producing a substantial platformer game.
          I was in charge of the Unity scripts written in C#, which I had no prior experience in. 
          I also followed standard agile production pipelines, writing tests for each script; continuously integrating and deploying.
          This project sparked my interest in Game Development as we were able to produce a platformer game 
          with elements of stealth, education, with all of our own assets and creative storyline.

          Note: a link to the project is currently unavailable as the repository was made private on request of IBM.
