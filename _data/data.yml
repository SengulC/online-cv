    title: Profile
    summary: |
      Hello! I am Sengul (pronounced shen-gewl), a 20-year-old Computer Science graduate from the University of Bristol passionate 
      about blending creativity and technology. Since I was 17, I've been captivated by programming, 
      crafting dynamic programs and innovative websites. My journey began in high school, where I scored a perfect 7/7 
      in Computer Science during my IB diploma and wrote a 30-page Extended Essay that marked my 
      introduction to web development and formal user-centric evaluation.
      Most recently, I completed my Bachelor Thesis, achieving a 75% mark which placed me in 
      the top 10 of UoB's 2024 Computer Science BSc finalists.
      With this project I honed the aforementioned skills to a professional level 
      with the inclusion of AI. I am currently located in Cyprus but am seeking on-site or hybrid opportunities in Europe, namely: Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Dublin, Paris.
      I aspire to dive into my passions of web development, 
      game development, and all of the creative intersections within tech.

      - role: Intern (Full Stack Development)
        time: Summer of 2023
        company: CYENS, Nicosia, Cyprus
        details: |
          I initially joined a 2-person team as the frontend lead. I familiarized myself with Streamlit and the front/backend pipeline.
          Later, the backend representative of the team changed and I helped onboard the new member, facilitating a smooth transition.
          Towards the end of the project, I was the only intern remaining in the team and so I took on managing the fullstack pipeline as
          well as deployment. Please note that the website is currently inaccessible. However a [project presentation and website demo are available here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X7vNBumbUSQB3mpHiEetdd8wUHN-5t3I?usp=sharing)
          
          We developed an AI-driven interactive storyteller for kids, enabling them to create 
          fictional and historical stories through AI-generated options. 
          The user would enter an initial prompt for the story, and thereafter would continue said story via the AI-generated options.
          The project was inspired by choose your own adventure story books.
          As an extension to the project, I integrated a text-to-image AI API, Stable Diffusion, to accompany the story.
          The project was interactive via story continuation, AI hyper-parameter customizations; and 
          open-ended as the story wouldn't end until you wanted it to.

      - role: Intern (Design)
        time: Summer of 2020
        company: DesignLab Marketing/Advertising, Nicosia, Cyprus
        details: |
          My interest in digital design has been ever-present, however I was able to put it into formal action during 
          my work experience at DesignLab. 
          Shadowing work in a creative office developed my communication skills as it allowed me to share my ideas freely. 
          I, then, went onto do practical work in the digital media field; strengthening my independent 
          learning on Adobe Photoshop and GIMP.
          Both during and after my internship, I continued learning about two platforms
          for digital design: Photoshop (the commercial standard), and GIMP (a commonly used alternative). 
          I explored both of these software beyond the scope of my initial internship (digital marketing), 
          creating preliminary posters.
          - Collaborative brainstorming
          - 2D marketing design

      - title: Stormboard (Bachelor Thesis)
        link: "https://stormboard.vercel.app/"
        tagline: "An AI-powered brainstorming website enquiring the creativity and collaboration of autonomous AI."
        details: |
          In my first class bachelor thesis I explored the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Human-Computer Interaction.
          I developed a node-based graphical user interface, digitally mirroring brainstorming with 
          sticky notes given a contextual design brief, and added the feature to 'supercharge' these sticky notes. 
          [Repository link (with access to Thesis PDF.)](https://github.com/SengulC/stormboard-client)

          A user can 'supercharge' aka add AI to their notes in the following ways:
          - Add a new AI-created note
          - Summarize/Expand on a note
          - Merge 1+ notes into another note
          - Semantically group 1+ notes
          - Find the semantic opposite of a note
          - Add randomness to a given note 

          I wanted to explore the concept of autonomous AI, and how the collaboration of 
          human and AI agents affects human creativity.
          Thus, I created three distinct AI personas, with ranging levels of autonomy and 
          with each having their own stylistic tone to their additions/modifications. These are:
          - Hades with no autonomy and a netural tone,
          - Apollo with full autonomy^ and a descriptive, creative tone,
          - Themis with slight autonomy^^ and a precise, succinct tone.

          ^ can manipulate the user's notes in any of the above supercharged ways

          ^^ summarizes all of the user's notes in a user-chosen time period (e.g. every 2 seconds)

          I developed these personas by role-based prompting my OpenAI API backend calls.
          
          In my thesis, I thoroughly explore the technical and creative aspects of autonomous AI and human collaboration.
          I reached the conclusion that although not perfect, Stormboard served as a great vessel to measure how much, or rather in what ways,
          users like to preserve control over their creative artifacts. 
          I also identified a few ideation processes and techniques that users greatly benefit from AI input therein, 
          e.g. clarifying and grouping ideas; expanding on ideas with professional, state-of-the-art 
          information whilst staying within the context defined by the user.

      - title: GAL4CTIC Game in Collaboration with IBM
        link: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mxNK3JlQd9QeWxq333_eXCRHj1nuEGQY/view?usp=sharing"
        tagline: "A first class collaborative software engineering project, where I developed a platformer stealth game (GAL4CTIC) on Unity."
        details: |
          This year-long project was an excellent introduction to collaborative software engineering with a client from IBM.
          We held frequent meetings, delegated work to each team mate, managed and overcame miscommunications 
          and disagreements, producing a substantial platformer game.
          I was in charge of the Unity scripts written in C#, which I had no prior experience in. 
          I followed standard agile production pipelines, writing tests for each script; continuously integrating and deploying.
          This project sparked my interest in Game Development as we were able to produce a platformer game 
          with elements of stealth, education, with all of our own assets and creative storyline. 
          All done in under a year with slim-to-none technical guidance from clients, mentors or lecturers.

          Please note that a link to the project is unavailable as its repository is private, 
          however a demo video of the game can be found in the link above.

      - title: Distributed and Parallel implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Go
        link: "https://github.com/SengulC/gol-distr"
        tagline: "An upper-second class pair-programming Go coursework on the distributed and parallel execution of the Game of Life."
        details: |
          The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Conway in 1970.
          It is a zero-player game; its evolution is determined by its initial state and a ruleset.

          In the initial steps of this project, we implemented a single-threaded execution of Conway’s Game of Life.
          Our program took in a PGM image and transformed it into a 2D slice of bytes, which represented the state 
          of the game world after a specified number of turns.

          To make the first step in our distributed implementation, we followed a simple client-server model, 
          with our local controller acting as the client, and a single AWS node acting as the server side- the worker. 
          Our latest version of the distributed implementation includes fault tolerance. 
          The way in which we implemented fault tolerance allows for the local distributor 
          to connect to the worker, and at any given moment quit the local controller in a way that pauses 
          the current worker execution, allowing for a new local controller to connect to the server and 
          pick up where the previous client left off.

          More information on the system design, development, and debugging throughout our process can be
          found in our final report through the link above.
